# Image-Slider
Display image slides by increasing the counter or decreasing it
The Code consist of a Div with ID [wrapper], 7 images, and two buttons to display slies upon click.<br>
To Display the image, this is the code to do so [x[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";]<br>
When pressing on the Prev Buttom, the code to display images in a backword order is [slideIndex = x.length;]<br>
When pressing on the Next Buttom, the code to display images in a Forward order is [slideIndex = 1;]<br>
Whenever, a specific image is displayed, the for loop will allow change in slider counter [x]. <br>
Whenever a slide is selected, we use this code [x[i].style.display = "none";] to stop the for loop until the counter [x] is changed.
